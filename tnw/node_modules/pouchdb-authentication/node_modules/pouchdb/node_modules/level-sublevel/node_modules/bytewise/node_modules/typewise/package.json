  "readme": "# typewise\n\nTypewise structured sorting for arbirarily complex data structures.\n\n[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/typewise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/typewise)\n\nThis library defines and implements the collation used by the [bytewise](https://github.com/deanlandolt/bytewise-core) encoding library.\n\nNOTE: the core typewise sorting functionality has been completely rewritten and moved to [typewise-core](https://github.com/deanlandolt/typewise-core). This library extends the data structures and comparators available to support more exotic types like ordered maps and sets, and shortlex-ordered tuples and records.\n\n\n## Type system\n\nIn order to properly express the rules for sorting and equality for a wide range of structures `typewise` defines a simple type system for controlling these properties across a range of data structures.\n\nA `typewise` type profile can be provide when creating a bytewise codec to control encoding and decoding behavior for specific types. Types may also contain high and low sentinal values that can be used to create `range` types which may be impossible be instantiate directly as instances.\n\nFor example, dates have no valid infinatary instances, but something analogous to the \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" dates is a useful construct for defining date intervals.\n\n\n## Issues\n\nIssues should be reported [here](https://github.com/deanlandolt/bytewise/issues).\n\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://deanlandolt.mit-license.org/)\n",
